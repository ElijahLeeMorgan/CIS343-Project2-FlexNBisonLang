| Criteria           | Full Points                                                                                                   | Partial Points                                              | Zero Points                                                      |

| Compilation        | Compiles with no errors or warnings; perfectly adheres to style guide; all requirements implemented correctly | Compiles with warnings; minor style guide mistakes; 1–2 requirements omitted | Doesn’t compile; fails to follow style guide; more than 2 requirements omitted |
| Error Handling     | Gracefully handles user errors (e.g., invalid commands) and validates numeric ranges (color values 0–255, points within screen limits, etc.) | Handles at least one type of error gracefully                | No error handling included                                        |

### Notes:
* Please make sure to test your program thoroughly and handle invalid input cases to avoid losing points.
* Adherence to the style guide is mandatory. Check your code formatting before submission.
